== Description ==

If your business relies on the WooCommerce platform, integrating it with Megaventory will bring you superior inventory and order management while keeping your products and clients synced across WooCommerce and Megaventory over multiple physical inventory locations in real-time. The Megaventory Inventory Management extension by Megaventory, Inc. upgrades your WooCommerce eshop so that you are able to fulfil your WooCommerce orders efficiently through the Megaventory ERP platform. Megaventory tracks inventory levels over multiple physical inventory locations and pushes that information selectively back to WooCommerce. Purchase Orders / Purchase Bills / Production (Bill Of Materials) Orders and Bundles-Kit management is also fully supported.

= With Megaventory, your WooCommerce site can be upgraded in the following ways: =

* You’ll be able to show in real-time your products’ availability in your WooCommerce frontend based on actual stock levels of multiple inventory locations.
* You can connect more than one warehouse, store, or other location at your disposal, and the WooCommerce frontend's stock representation will be correct.
* Once an order arrives in WooCommerce you’ll have the capability to process it properly from approval to shipment/invoicing to closing in the Megaventory backend ensuring a best-practices approach in running your e-shop.
* Information in one system is automatically synced to the other, saving significant time you would otherwise be spending making double entries.
* Additional functionality such as bundling, returns, Bills of Materials etc. is also seamlessly handled.

= How the plugin works =

The Megaventory Inventory Management extension will create an additional section in your WooCommerce admin panel where you can manage the plugin from.
In order to use the Megaventory Inventory Management plugin, it is necessary to enter a few initial settings and perform an initial sync with your Megaventory account (both one-off tasks).

Following a successful sync, you will either access Megaventory to fulfil and manage your orders or login to WooCommerce for the usual functionality.
In any case, double entry is eliminated and any relevant information which can be synced is transferred in the background by the plugin.
